# Linux System Scanner

This project implements the Kaaiot API to provide remote access and system scanning for your Linux machine. The code utilizes tools like `cpuinfo`, `psutil`, `GPUtil`, and `subprocess`, continuously scanning your Linux system and sending the data to Kaaiot via MQTT. From Kaaiot, you can view the data as an endpoint and execute console commands without the need for a static IP.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3.12-venv
   pip install setuptools
   ```

2. Install the project using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone -b AGILE-5592 https://github.com/vnpmgit/mqtt-client-python.git
   cd mqtt-client-python
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   cd examples/sys_scan/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Launch the Project

Start the project by running:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Upon your first launch, you may encounter a series of errors:

The program scans your system and attempts to send the data, but it doesn't know where to send it due to missing environment variables such as `DEFAULT_KPC_HOST`, `APPLICATION_VERSION`, and `ENDPOINT_TOKEN`. Hereâ€™s how to get them.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To resolve the issue, you need to create a new application and an endpoint. The application acts as a storage for your Linux servers, providing default settings for each one. Within this application, you will create an endpoint to receive and view generated data, as well as to execute commands remotely.

### Steps to Create an Application

1. **Open Kaaiot**: Navigate to the Applications tab, choose a name for your application, and create it.

2. **Add a Device**: In the Devices tab, select your application from the dropdown and click "Add device". Choose a name for the device and create it.

3. **Copy the Token**: You will be greeted with a token. Copy it. That is `ENDPOINT_TOKEN`, 1 out of the 3 required variables.

4. **Get Application Version**: Open your newly created device and copy the second variable, `appVersion.name`. This will be `APPLICATION_VERSION`, the 2 out of 3 variables.

5. **Get Default KPC Host**: Finally, copy domain from the URL of your Kaaiot console. This is the `DEFAULT_KPC_HOST`, the third variable.

## Provisioning Your Python Script

In your terminal, set these environment variables:

```bash
export DEFAULT_KPC_HOST="YOUR_KCP_HOST"
export DEFAULT_KPC_PORT="1883"
export APPLICATION_VERSION="YOUR_APPLICATION_VERSION"
export ENDPOINT_TOKEN="YOUR_ENDPOINT_TOKEN"
```

Now you can launch the program with `python3 main.py`, and hopefully, you will start receiving data.

## Executing Commands

In your device page, navigate to the Commands section. You can execute terminal commands from Kaaiot and view the output in JSON format. To do this:

1. Set "Command type" to `LINUX_COMMAND`.
2. As an example payload, send:

```json
{"command": "ls"}
```

This is it! From this point, you should hopefully be able to execute commands and view data from your Linux system. Thank you for following this guide.
